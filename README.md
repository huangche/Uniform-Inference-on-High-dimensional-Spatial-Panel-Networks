# Uniform-Inference-on-High-dimensional-Spatial-Panel-Networks

Here, you can find the R codes to implement the simulation study described in the article 'Uniform Inference on High-dimensional Spatial Panel Networks' by Chernozhukov V, Huang C and Wang W. (arXiv preprint arXiv: 2105.07424: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07424).

The two auxiliary functions, Theta.hat_CLIME and find_mus, used for constrained l1-minimization for inverse matrix estimation (CLIME) and tuning parameter selection, are based on the R codes from the GitHub repository https://github.com/LedererLab/HDIV, contributed by David Gold and Johannes Lederer.
